This is the python script for the random number guessing game

This script runs a function called start_game and runs until the user exits the game

The function although it relies on lots of different variables and data, has four main data points that are declared at the beginning of the function

1. random_number = int: random number generated by python random library
2. game_over = boolean: variable deciding if the game is still in play
3. guess_attempts = list of integers: list containing the guesses of the player
4. high_score = int: variable storing the highest score during the function


The rest of the function runs on a while loop, if the variable game_over is false, then the while loop will continue to run.

Within the while loop, the user is prompted for a number guess and that number guess is then fed through a bunch of if statements to determine if the user guessed the right number or not. 

After that the user is prompted on whether or not they would like to play again. The input from the user is then processed through a handful of if statements to handle playing again, quitting or invalid responses.# number-guessing-game
